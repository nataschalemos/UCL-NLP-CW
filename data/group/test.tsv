Holy shit. I'm so overwhelmed by the technology of the Xbox Series X, as this excellent video from @ digitalfoundry shows, but then I realize that the Xbox has so little exclusivity, and then there are few I like... reality collapses hard.... youtu.be / qcY4nRHapmE	2	12851
Played Valorant for the first time again today. Good stuff. Feels a lot like CS : GO, but that's expected. Also reminds me of Shadowrun ( August 2007 ), which was like Super CS but with 12 abilities, different but only has 4 extra characters / classes instead of a much more Overwatch - like character difference pattern of abilities. I like it.	2	4344
